Ever been to [Mannheim][1]? If not – this is your chance to visit
this lovely city. For the Helios release, the guys behind the
[majug²][2] (Mannheimer Java user Group) invite everybody to the Helios
[Democamp][3] in June. And as [Ian][4] already [found out][5]\: Yes, we
love our DemoCamps! It’s always great to have technical discussions over
a frosty beverage!

At the moment, the attendee list is still pretty empty but [save
yourself][7] a seat while it’s not booked out – they only have 100 seats
available. Topics this year include [EGit][8], [EclipseRT][9],
[Android][10] and [Roo][11]. Do you think a cool topic is missing? Step
up and give a demo about what you’re doing! I’m really looking forward
to see more demos of how people use Eclipse as IDE or runtime.

Hope to see you there for another great DemoCamp and ad-hoc
Stammtisch![^footnote]
