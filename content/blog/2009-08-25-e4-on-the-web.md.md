With [e4 0.9][1] out in the wild, we should think again about the goals
e4 tries to provide. One of them was to reduce the gap between Desktop
and Web – not only speaking of reusing widgets but also to enable the
platform handle multi-user scenarios. While the core e4 team
concentrated on eliminating bad smells like singletons, the RAP team
worked on better support for single sourcing applications in general.
With an experimental version of RAP which includes some features not yet
in the current release, we were able to run the demo out of the box
including the whole underlying infrastructure like the modeled workbench
– without touching the e4 code.

If you take a look at the [RAP Demos][2] page you’ll find the e4
contacts demo running on RAP. If you want to try it out yourself or even
help to contribute to this effort, take a look this [wiki page][3]. In
case you’re interested what you can do with e4, be sure to participate
in the [e4 webinars][4].This week, there will be Part 2 with topics like
RAP, the Compatibility layer and the flexible resources model. Looking
at the questions that came up in the last [RAP webinar][5] and the first
part of the E4 webinar, people seem to be very interested how e4 and RAP
play together. I’ll try to answer the open questions during the webinar
this week. Looking forward to a great event.
