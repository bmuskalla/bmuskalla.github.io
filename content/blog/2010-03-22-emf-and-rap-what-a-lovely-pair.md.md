During the last weeks, [Kenn][1] and I worked together to support
[EMF][2] generated editors running on RAP. I’m always mesmerized by how
effective such synergies can be used when people from different teams
work together for a bigger goal. Kudos to Kenn for his great work in EMF
by refactoring the EMF UI bundles (namely o.e.emf.ui.common and
o.e.emf.ui.edit) in order to single-source them. But what does that mean
for the community?

Go out, grab EMF &amp; RAP M6 from Helios, get your model ready, fire up
properties view and switch “Rich Ajax Platform” to true. Hit the magic
“Generate All” button and you’re done – an EMF backed RAP application.

For the details, please refer to the [EMF/RAP integration][5] wiki page.

In case you want to see what else is going on in the RAP space right
now, I’ll be giving a [RAP 1.3 N&amp;N talk][6] tomorrow at EclipseCon.
Hope to see you there!
