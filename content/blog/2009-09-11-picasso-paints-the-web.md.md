Whenever Iâ€™m working on UI stuff, something always goes terribly wrong ðŸ˜‰
Sometimes itâ€™s only a margin or padding, other times it a composite that
crosses my path. I was pretty happy that Chris Aniszczyk and Simon
Archer hacked together [Picasso][1], which helps you to identify some of
these layout issues. As you may know, most of the time I work on the
[Rich Ajax Platform][2] (RAP) and come across the same issues. As
[Picasso][3] was originally intended to work for RCP, itâ€™s not a long
way to get it working for RAP.

In case youâ€™re struggling with these issues too â€“ Â and working on RAP
applications, please add your vote to [bug 267975][5] so we can use
Picasso on both runtimes.[^footnote]
