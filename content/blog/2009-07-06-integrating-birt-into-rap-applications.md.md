Finally I had some time to write down some of my experiences with
integrating the [Business Intelligence Reporting Tools][1] (BIRT) into a
[Rich Ajax Platform][2] (RAP) application. I wrote it all down in a
[small tutorial][3] that shows how you can integrate charts and reports
seamlessly in your RAP application. Topics covered in the tutorial
include how to setup the environment to let BIRT and RAP play well
together.

Many thanks to BIRT committer, Virgil Dodson, to help with this
tutorial- it was really great to get Eclipse committers from different
projects working together!
