Ok, itâ€™s getting tough. Only 9 days left before EclipseCon officially
starts. All contributors and committers around me are already swarming
around to get the demos and presentations ready â€“ besides fixing bugs
for the upcoming [M6 build][1]. But why is everybody so excited about
EclipseCon? I think the numerous talks are only one side of the coin.
Personally the way more interesting part is the come-together of all
people you know from bug reports, mailing lists and newsgroups. While it
is nice to see each other, it often brings up great discussions about
Eclipse technology â€“ especially interesting for me: [RAP][2] and
[E4][3].

The number of [BoFs][4] this year is tremendous. If youâ€™re developing
RAP applications or planning to use RAP in the near future, you should
definitly visit me and the [rest of the team][5] at the [RAP BoF][6]. As
this is the first BoF for the RAP project weâ€™re really excited to see
whoâ€™s coming. If youâ€™re planning to attend, why donâ€™t you just add some
of your ideas to the [list of discussion topics][6]? The intention of
BoFs is that you have the chance to talk directly with the RAP
committers and give the team the chance to see your standpoints. Take
the chance to poke us for all the [bugs][7] we didnâ€™t fix yet ðŸ˜‰ Or if
youâ€™re interested to see any of the long-standing feature requests to be
added to the plan â€“ no problem (at least if you have enough beer for the
team)! Weâ€™re looking forward to some lively discussions â€“ not just as
part of the BoF![^footnote]
